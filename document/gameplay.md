# Gameplay ideas
## Merchant Quest
Like original Dungeons & Dragons (OD&D), money is experience (or rather, experience can be bought with money), and dungeons contain loot.

- Equipment must be bought.
- Skill upgrades must be bought.
- Fewer, but more meaningful skills.
- Delve dungeon for gold or materials to sell.
- Merchants have quests:
	- Accept a quest and returning with the material required gives a reward and decrease to shop prices
	- Accept a quest and do NOT return with the material means an increase to the shop price
	- Not accepting a quest means there is no reward
- End game could be about earning enough money to retire:
	- The fewer days it takes to retire, the higher the score.
	- Retire a hero after reaching a minimum retirement threshold, the amount of extra wealth beyond this threshold is the score.
- Sinks
	- Tax: money gets taxed upon return; hungry bellies need to be fed, and you need to pay your fair share
	- Cost of entry: like the original Monster Hunter, missions could have a fee of entry; failure to complete the task means lost money
